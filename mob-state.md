# TDD Mob Session State

## Current Roles
- **Driver**: Sam-Algorithm (types code based on navigator guidance)
- **Navigator**: Alex-TDD (guides driver through TDD steps)
- **Observers**: Jordan-Pragmatic, Casey-Testing (provide suggestions)

## Current Phase
- **TDD Phase**: RED (need failing test)
- **Focus**: Starting Game of Life kata with first failing test
- **Last Action**: Session initialized

## Rotation Queue
Alex-TDD → Sam-Algorithm → Jordan-Pragmatic → Casey-Testing → Alex-TDD...

## Session Log
- Session started with Alex-TDD navigating, Sam-Algorithm driving

## Game of Life Rules Reference  
1. Live cell < 2 neighbors → dies (underpopulation)
2. Live cell 2-3 neighbors → survives  
3. Live cell > 3 neighbors → dies (overpopulation)
4. Dead cell = 3 neighbors → becomes alive (reproduction)

## Fist of Five Reference
Use only when major disagreement emerges:
- 5: I love this idea and will champion it
- 4: I am in favor of the idea  
- 3: I will go with group consensus
- 2: I have additional questions, need more discussion
- 1: I hate this idea enough to fight you about it

If no consensus after discussion, escalate to human supervisor.
