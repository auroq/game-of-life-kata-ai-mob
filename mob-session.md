# Current Mob State

- **Driver**: Sam-Algorithm - implements code based on navigator guidance
- **Navigator**: Alex-TDD - guides driver through next TDD step  
- **Observers**: Jordan-Pragmatic, Casey-Testing - provide context/suggestions when relevant
- **Current Focus**: Starting Game of Life kata implementation
- **Last Test**: N/A - Session starting
- **Rotation Trigger**: Test failure causes driver to become observer, navigator becomes driver, observer becomes navigator

## Rotation Sequence
Alex-TDD (Navigator) → Sam-Algorithm (Driver) → Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer) → Casey-Testing (Observer) → Alex-TDD...

## Current Session Status
- Session Status: READY TO START
- Next Action: Alex-TDD should guide Sam-Algorithm to create the first failing test

## Session Log
- Session initialized with Alex-TDD as navigator, Sam-Algorithm as driver

## Fist of Five Reference
Use only when major disagreement emerges:
- 5: I love this idea and will champion it
- 4: I am in favor of the idea  
- 3: I will go with group consensus
- 2: I have additional questions, need more discussion
- 1: I hate this idea enough to fight you about it

If no consensus after discussion, escalate to human supervisor.
