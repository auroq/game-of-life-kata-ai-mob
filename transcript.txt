# Game of Life TDD Mob Programming Session Transcript

## Session Overview
This transcript captures a TDD mob programming session implementing Conway's Game of Life using AI agents simulating different mob roles.

## Session Results

### Final Project Structure
- game.go: Core Game of Life implementation with Cell and Grid types
- game_test.go: Comprehensive test suite covering all Game of Life rules
- analysis.md: Post-session analysis of the mob programming experiment
- mob-state.md: Mob programming session state and role definitions

### Key Implementation Milestones
1. Started with Cell struct and NextState method
2. Implemented all 4 Game of Life rules through TDD:
   - Dead cell with 3 neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)
   - Live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
   - Live cell with <2 neighbors dies (underpopulation)  
   - Live cell with >3 neighbors dies (overpopulation)
3. Added Grid struct with neighbor counting logic
4. Implemented NextGeneration method for grid evolution
5. Tested classic "blinker" pattern oscillation

### Mob Programming Roles Used
- Alex-TDD: Navigator focused on strict TDD discipline
- Sam-Algorithm: Driver/Navigator with algorithm expertise
- Jordan-Pragmatic: Driver focused on simple, practical solutions
- Casey-Testing: Observer/Navigator emphasizing edge cases and testing

### TDD Cycles Completed
Multiple Red-Green-Refactor cycles were completed, building functionality incrementally from basic cell behavior to complex grid patterns.

### Final Assessment
The session successfully implemented a complete Game of Life using TDD principles, but revealed limitations in AI mob programming simulation compared to direct AI implementation.

## Technical Artifacts Generated
- Complete Game of Life implementation in Go
- 100% rule coverage through systematic testing
- Working blinker pattern validation
- Clean separation between Cell and Grid concerns
