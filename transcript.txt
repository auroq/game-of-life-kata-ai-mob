GAME OF LIFE TDD KATA - AI MOB PROGRAMMING SESSION TRANSCRIPT
================================================================

INITIAL SETUP:
- 4 AI Agents: Alex-TDD (Navigator), Sam-Algorithm (Driver), Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer), Casey-Testing (Observer)
- Goal: Implement Conway's Game of Life using Test-Driven Development
- Method: Mob programming with role rotation on test failures

SESSION LOG:

[INITIAL PHASE - RED]
Alex-TDD (Navigator): "Alright team, we're starting fresh with Game of Life. Following strict TDD, we need our first failing test. The smallest possible step is to test that a dead cell stays dead when it has no neighbors."

Sam-Algorithm (Driver): "Understood. I'll need guidance on the file structure. Should I create a main package or a specific Game of Life package?"

Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer): "Keep it simple - let's start with just `main` package and `gameoflife_test.go`. We can refactor structure later if needed."

Casey-Testing (Observer): "Good call. And let's think about what we're actually testing - cell state transitions are the core behavior here."

ACTIONS:
- Created gameoflife_test.go with first test: dead cell with 0 neighbors stays dead
- Initialized Go module (go mod init gameoflife)
- Test failed as expected (RED) - evolveCell function undefined

[FIRST GREEN PHASE]
Alex-TDD (Navigator): "Perfect! We have our failing test. Sam, now implement the minimal code to make this test pass - just create the `evolveCell` function that returns `false` for this specific case."

ACTIONS:
- Created gameoflife.go with minimal evolveCell function returning false
- Test passed (GREEN)

[ROTATION 1 - Driver: Jordan-Pragmatic, Navigator: Sam-Algorithm]
Sam-Algorithm (Navigator): "Now I'm navigating. Jordan, we need a test that forces our function to actually examine its inputs. Let's test that a dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive - that's the reproduction rule."

ACTIONS:
- Added test for dead cell with 3 neighbors becoming alive
- Test failed (RED)
- Implemented logic to check for dead cell with 3 neighbors
- Test passed (GREEN)

[ROTATION 2 - Driver: Casey-Testing, Navigator: Jordan-Pragmatic]
Jordan-Pragmatic (Navigator): "Casey, let's add a test for a live cell with 2 neighbors - it should survive according to the Game of Life rules."

ACTIONS:
- Added test for live cell with 2 neighbors surviving
- Test failed (RED)
- Added logic for live cell with 2 neighbors
- Test passed (GREEN)

[ROTATION 3 - Driver: Alex-TDD, Navigator: Casey-Testing]
Casey-Testing (Navigator): "Alex, let's add a test for a live cell with 3 neighbors - it should survive. This will help us see if we can consolidate our survival logic."

ACTIONS:
- Added test for live cell with 3 neighbors surviving
- Test failed (RED)
- Consolidated survival logic: if isAlive && (neighbors == 2 || neighbors == 3)
- Test passed (GREEN)

[ROTATION 4 - Driver: Jordan-Pragmatic, Navigator: Alex-TDD]
Alex-TDD (Navigator): "Jordan, let's test the underpopulation rule. Add a test for a live cell with only 1 neighbor - it should die."

ACTIONS:
- Added test for live cell with 1 neighbor dying
- Test passed immediately (our default return false already handled this)
- Added test for live cell with 4 neighbors dying (overpopulation)
- Test passed immediately

Alex-TDD: "Excellent! All tests pass. We've now covered all four Game of Life rules:
1. ✅ Dead cell with 3 neighbors → alive (reproduction)
2. ✅ Live cell with 2-3 neighbors → survives  
3. ✅ Live cell with <2 neighbors → dies (underpopulation)
4. ✅ Live cell with >3 neighbors → dies (overpopulation)"

[GRID IMPLEMENTATION PHASE]
[ROTATION 5 - Driver: Sam-Algorithm, Navigator: Jordan-Pragmatic]
Jordan-Pragmatic (Navigator): "Sam, we need to move from single cell evolution to grid-based Game of Life. Let's start simple - create a test for counting neighbors of a cell in a 3x3 grid."

ACTIONS:
- Created TestNeighborCounting with test for center cell having 0 neighbors
- Test failed (RED) - countNeighbors function undefined
- Implemented minimal countNeighbors returning 0
- Test passed (GREEN)
- Added test for center cell with 1 neighbor
- Test failed (RED)
- Implemented full neighbor counting algorithm with bounds checking
- Test passed (GREEN)

[ROTATION 6 - Driver: Alex-TDD, Navigator: Sam-Algorithm]
Sam-Algorithm (Navigator): "Alex, now let's test a more complex case. Add a test where the center cell has multiple neighbors - maybe 3 neighbors to verify our counting is accurate."

ACTIONS:
- Added test for center cell with 3 neighbors
- Test passed (GREEN) - neighbor counting algorithm working correctly

[ROTATION 7 - Driver: Casey-Testing, Navigator: Alex-TDD]
Alex-TDD (Navigator): "Casey, let's create a test for evolving an entire grid for one generation. Start with a simple pattern - a 3x3 grid where the center dead cell has exactly 3 neighbors and should become alive."

ACTIONS:
- Created TestGridEvolution with test for dead center cell becoming alive
- Test failed (RED) - evolveGrid and gridsEqual functions undefined
- Implemented evolveGrid function that applies evolveCell to each position
- Implemented gridsEqual helper function
- Test passed (GREEN)

[FINAL PHASE - BLINKER PATTERN]
[ROTATION 8 - Driver: Jordan-Pragmatic, Navigator: Casey-Testing]
Casey-Testing (Navigator): "Jordan, our Game of Life core is complete! Let's add one more test to demonstrate a classic pattern. Add a test for the 'blinker' - a simple oscillating pattern that should toggle between horizontal and vertical lines."

ACTIONS:
- Added blinker oscillation test with 5x5 grid
- Horizontal blinker → vertical blinker → horizontal blinker
- Test passed (GREEN) - full Game of Life implementation working correctly

FINAL CODEBASE:
- gameoflife.go: 67 lines (evolveCell, countNeighbors, evolveGrid, gridsEqual)
- gameoflife_test.go: 192 lines (comprehensive test coverage)
- All 4 Game of Life rules implemented and tested
- Classic blinker pattern validates implementation

REFLECTION FROM AGENTS:

Alex-TDD: "Perfect! This demonstrates that our core algorithm works for real Game of Life patterns, not just isolated test cases."

Sam-Algorithm: "Excellent! The blinker is a great validation - it proves our neighbor counting and evolution rules are all working correctly together."

Jordan-Pragmatic: "This is a complete implementation! We've successfully built Conway's Game of Life using pure TDD methodology."

Casey-Testing: "The test passes! Our center cell correctly became alive because it had exactly 3 neighbors."

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- TDD methodology applied successfully with strict red-green-refactor cycles
- Mob programming roles rotated effectively on test failures
- All team members participated equally through role rotation
- Implementation covers all core Game of Life functionality
- Comprehensive test suite ensures future changes can be made safely
