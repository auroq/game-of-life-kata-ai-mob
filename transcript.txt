GAME OF LIFE TDD MOB PROGRAMMING SESSION TRANSCRIPT

=== SESSION START ===

USER: Read mob-state.md and let's start the Game of Life TDD kata

CLAUDE: [Reading mob-state.md and creating todo list]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! We're in the RED phase and I'm navigating with Sam-Algorithm driving. Let's start with the absolute smallest failing test we can write. Sam, create a new file called `game_test.go` and write a test for a single dead cell that should remain dead.

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Got it! I'll create the most minimal test structure. Writing a test for the simplest case - a dead cell with no neighbors should stay dead.

[Creates game_test.go with first failing test]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Good start! Simple function signature - takes current state and neighbor count.

**[Casey-Testing]**: I like that we're starting with the boundary case of zero neighbors.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! Now Sam, run the test to make sure it fails with a compilation error since `nextState` doesn't exist yet.

[Runs test, gets compilation failure, creates go.mod]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Excellent! We have our RED - compilation failure. Now we're ready to rotate since we hit a failure. According to TDD mob rules, test failure triggers rotation!

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Now I'm navigating! Jordan, as our new driver, let's move to GREEN phase. Create `game.go` and implement the absolute minimal `nextState` function to make this test pass.

USER: Continue

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Got it! I'm driving now. Let me create the simplest possible implementation to make that test pass.

[Creates game.go with minimal implementation returning false]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Perfect! That's the minimal implementation. Now run the test to confirm we're GREEN.

[Tests pass]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Excellent! We're GREEN. Now let's add another failing test to force us to improve the implementation. Jordan, add a test for the reproduction rule - dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors should become alive.

[Adds reproduction test]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Good choice! Testing the reproduction rule with exactly 3 neighbors.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Nice addition! Let's run the test to get back to RED.

[Test fails as expected]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Perfect! We're back in RED with a failing test. Time to rotate again!

- Sam-Algorithm (Navigator) â†’ Observer
- Jordan-Pragmatic (Driver) â†’ Observer  
- Casey-Testing (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Alex-TDD (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Casey-Testing]**: I'm navigating now! Alex, as our new driver, let's implement the minimal logic to handle the reproduction rule. Update the `nextState` function to return true when we have a dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors.

USER: continue

**[Alex-TDD]**: Roger that, Casey! I'll implement the minimal change to make both tests pass.

[Implements reproduction logic]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Perfect! Let's run the tests to confirm we're GREEN again.

[Tests pass]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Excellent! We're GREEN. Now let's add a test for live cells. Alex, add a test for a live cell with 2 neighbors - it should survive according to rule 2.

USER: Continue

**[Alex-TDD]**: Got it! I'll add a test for the survival rule - live cell with 2 neighbors should stay alive.

[Adds survival test]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Great! Now let's run the test to get back to RED.

[Test fails]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Perfect! We're RED again. Time for another rotation!

- Sam-Algorithm (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: I'm navigating again! Jordan, you're driving. Let's implement the survival logic for live cells with 2 neighbors. Update the function to handle this case.

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Right! I'll add the minimal logic to handle live cells with 2 neighbors.

[Implements survival logic for 2 neighbors]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Excellent! Let's verify we're GREEN.

[Tests pass]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Perfect! All tests are passing. Now Jordan, let's add another test - live cell with 3 neighbors should also survive according to rule 2.

[Adds test for live cell with 3 neighbors]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Good thinking! Let's see if this test fails.

[Test fails]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Perfect! We're RED again with a failing test. Time to rotate!

- Casey-Testing (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Alex-TDD]**: I'm navigating now! Casey, you're driving. Let's fix this by adding the case for live cells with 3 neighbors.

USER: continue

**[Casey-Testing]**: Got it! I'll add the logic for live cells with 3 neighbors to survive.

[Adds survival logic for 3 neighbors]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! Let's run the tests to confirm we're GREEN.

[Tests pass]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Excellent! All tests passing. Now I see some duplication - we can refactor this. Casey, let's combine those conditions for live cells with 2 or 3 neighbors.

[Refactors to combine conditions]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Nice refactor! That's much cleaner.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Let's verify our refactor didn't break anything.

[Tests still pass]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! Now let's add tests for the death rules. Casey, add a test for underpopulation - live cell with 1 neighbor should die.

[Adds underpopulation test]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Let's run the test to see if it passes or fails.

[Test passes - already handled by default case]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Interesting! The test already passes because our current implementation returns false for any case not explicitly handled.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Good observation! Let's add a test for overpopulation - live cell with 4 neighbors should die.

[Adds overpopulation test]

[Test passes]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Great! We've now covered all four rules of Conway's Game of Life. Our function correctly handles reproduction, survival, underpopulation, and overpopulation!

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! We've successfully implemented the core logic using TDD. We have comprehensive tests covering all the Game of Life rules and a clean, working implementation.

USER: continue

**[Alex-TDD]**: Excellent work everyone! We've successfully covered all four Game of Life rules. Now let's think about the next step - we need to move beyond single cells to handling a grid of cells.

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Right! We should start thinking about neighbor counting for cells in a 2D grid. That's the algorithmic core we need next.

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: I agree. Let's keep it simple - maybe start with a small fixed-size grid first.

**[Casey-Testing]**: We should test edge cases too - cells on the boundaries of the grid will have fewer neighbors.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Good point Casey! But first, let's rotate and add our next failing test. We need to start thinking about a grid structure.

- Sam-Algorithm (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: I'm navigating now! Jordan, you're driving. Let's start simple - create a test for a 3x3 grid where we can test neighbor counting. Add a test for counting neighbors of the center cell.

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Got it! I'll add a test for neighbor counting in a grid context.

[Adds TestNeighborCounting with center cell having 8 neighbors]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Perfect! Now let's run the test to get our expected compilation failure.

[Gets compilation error for missing countNeighbors function]

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Excellent! We're RED with a compilation failure. Time to rotate!

- Casey-Testing (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Alex-TDD (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Casey-Testing]**: I'm navigating now! Alex, you're driving. Let's implement the minimal `countNeighbors` function. For now, just hardcode it to return 8 to make this specific test pass.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Roger! I'll add the minimal implementation to make the test pass.

[Implements countNeighbors returning hardcoded 8]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Perfect! Let's run the tests to confirm we're GREEN.

[Tests pass]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Excellent! Now let's add another test case to force us to implement real neighbor counting logic. Alex, add a test for a center cell with only some neighbors alive - let's say 3 neighbors.

[Adds test for counting 3 neighbors]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Perfect! Now let's run the test to get back to RED.

[Test fails with Expected 3, got 8]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Excellent! We're RED. Time to rotate and implement proper neighbor counting!

- Jordan-Pragmatic (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Sam-Algorithm (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: I'm navigating now! Sam, you're driving. Let's implement the actual neighbor counting algorithm. We need to check all 8 surrounding cells around the given position.

USER: continue

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Got it! I'll implement the proper neighbor counting algorithm by checking all 8 surrounding cells.

[Implements full countNeighbors algorithm with boundary checking]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Perfect! That's a clean implementation that checks all 8 neighbors while handling boundary conditions. Let's run the tests to confirm we're GREEN.

[Tests pass]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let's add a test for edge cases - what happens when we count neighbors for a corner cell?

[Adds test for corner cell neighbor counting]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Great! Let's run the test to see if our boundary handling works correctly.

[Test passes]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Excellent! Our neighbor counting algorithm correctly handles boundary conditions. 

**[Casey-Testing]**: Perfect! Now we have solid neighbor counting. The next step would be to create a function that applies the Game of Life rules to an entire grid.

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Right! We can now combine our `nextState` function with our `countNeighbors` function to process a whole grid. Let's add a test for that.

[Adds TestGridEvolution]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Perfect! Now let's run the test to get our expected compilation failure.

[Gets compilation error for missing evolveGrid function]

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Excellent! We're RED with a compilation failure. Time to rotate!

- Jordan-Pragmatic (Navigator) â†’ Observer
- Sam-Algorithm (Driver) â†’ Observer  
- Alex-TDD (Observer) â†’ Navigator
- Casey-Testing (Observer) â†’ Driver

**[Alex-TDD]**: I'm navigating again! Casey, you're driving. Let's implement the `evolveGrid` function that combines our `nextState` and `countNeighbors` functions to evolve the entire grid.

USER: continue

**[Casey-Testing]**: Got it! I'll implement the `evolveGrid` function that applies the Game of Life rules to every cell in the grid.

[Implements evolveGrid function]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect! That's a clean implementation that creates a new grid and applies our rules to each cell. Let's run the tests to see if we're GREEN.

[All tests pass]

**[Alex-TDD]**: Excellent! All tests are passing. We've successfully implemented Conway's Game of Life using TDD! 

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: This is great! We now have a complete working implementation that handles single cell evolution, neighbor counting, and full grid evolution.

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Perfect! We've kept it simple with a fixed-size grid and clean, readable code.

**[Casey-Testing]**: I love how we've covered all the edge cases - boundary conditions, all four rules, and different neighbor counts.

**[Alex-TDD]**: Fantastic mob session everyone! We've successfully implemented Conway's Game of Life using strict TDD methodology. Let's run all our tests one final time to confirm everything works:

[Runs verbose test output showing all 13 passing tests]

**[Casey-Testing]**: Beautiful! 13 passing tests covering all aspects of Conway's Game of Life.

**[Sam-Algorithm]**: Our implementation correctly handles:
- All 4 Game of Life rules âœ…
- Neighbor counting for any grid position âœ…  
- Boundary condition handling âœ…
- Full grid evolution âœ…

**[Jordan-Pragmatic]**: Clean, simple design with excellent test coverage. This is exactly what TDD mob programming should produce!

**[Alex-TDD]**: Perfect kata execution! We followed strict TDD discipline - every feature was driven by failing tests, we made minimal implementations, and refactored when appropriate. The mob rotations kept everyone engaged and brought different perspectives to the solution.

## ðŸŽ‰ **TDD MOB SESSION COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰
